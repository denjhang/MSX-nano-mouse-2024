# MSX-nano-mouse-2024
 The latest version of the hardware is v0.4, which uses a blue plastic DB9 female connector directly welded to the PCB. In order to get this female DB9, you need to buy a wire-soldered DB9 female connector with fixing screw holes on both sides from Alex and use diagonal pliers to cut off the metal casing. Previous versions used a standard DB9 female socket, which may not plug into some older MSXs.
